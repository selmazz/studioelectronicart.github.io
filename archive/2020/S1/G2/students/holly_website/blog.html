		<p class="p2">My website menu was looking a little lonely, so I thought I'd do my reflection on this project in here</p>
		<p class="p3">What did you expect when starting this website?</p>
		<p class="p2">I had done html coding before during my undergrad, but I didn't really enjoy it that much, and didn't remember a lot from it. Usually for work I use other sites like Wordpress to help me out and speed it up a bit. However, I found this one more enjoyable.</p>
		<p class="p3">Why did you enjoy this one more?</p>
		<p class="p2">I think now that I have some experience, I know what I like and don't like. I'm not rushing to try everything out, I already have an idea in my mind on what it should be.</p>
		<p class="p3">What challenges did you face?</p>
		<p class="p2">I learnt before that the first rule of coding is that everything goes wrong aha. Because it had been so long, even resizing an image was proving to be hard (but we got there). There were lots of things I would've liked to do (drop down menu and image slideshow) but it was a bit beyond my level working with javascript. I did try it out, aaaaaaand I still have no idea how to get it to work. But I think it all comes with time and experience</p>
		<p class="p3">Did you find any useful sources for helping you out?</p>
		<p class="p2"> The w3schools website was a really helpful one, and had pretty much anything you could ever need. It was really good for when you got completely stuck or wanted to check over your code or see if there's something missing. That was the only 'formal' website I used. I had looked over a lot of forum posts on lots of sites which consisted of everyone saying they had the same problem with no solution, so I thought it would be better to keep everything simple for now.</p>
		<p class="p3">How do you think you went overall?</p>
		<p class="p2">I think this one turned out a lot better than my last attempts aha
		I need to work on tidying up my code a fair bit, just because I remember where things are doesn't mean everyone else will, and I still need to work on a methodology for working through tricky problems but I think that one also comes about with practice. Overall, I think I did pretty ok. I was using my portfolio as a style reference (which is linked in the about page) and tried to make it a bit different, which I think I did. For a first try I think it worked out well :) </p>
