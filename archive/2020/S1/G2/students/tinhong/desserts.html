		<h4>DESSERTS</h4>
		<p>Not a savoury person but more of a sweet tooth? Don't worry. Vietnamese desserts will satisfy your craving right away. The most typical one that you will find on the menu is 'che', also known as sweet dessert soup. There are almost 20 types of che, as you can see in the tiny bowls in the image, and they are created from different kinds of beans, taro, corn, or even tofu. Most of them can be served hot or cold with added pandan-flavoured coconut milk and roasted sesame seeds to give off that extra kick. Vietnamese also offer various types of cakes, jellies, etc. if you are not a fan of having soup as a dessert. </p>
