Hello!
Please enclose all of your site files inside a folder titled with your first name.
Make sure your file names do not contain spaces or weird characters, and all
lowercase is best.

For your first upload, head inside /firstyears/students, then click 'Upload files'.
Select your entire folder - not just its contents, and upload it.
For the first upload, click 'create a new branch', then click propose changes.
Then click 'Create pull request.'
I will approve the changes.

To update your work, head inside your own folder before uploading. When you upload
a file that has changes to the previous version, GitHub will update the files for you.
Do not under any circumstances edit other students' work. If you do so by accident
please let me know immediately so I can fix it!

Amy
