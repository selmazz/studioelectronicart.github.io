(Give it up!)</em> <br>By Franz Kafka.</br><br></br>It was very early in the morning, the streets were clean and empty as I walked to the train station. As I checked my watch against a clock tower I saw that it was already later than I had thought, I must make haste, the shock of this discovery left me unsure of the way, I did not know this city so well yet, luckily there was a watchman nearby, I walked up to him and breathlessly asked him the way. He smiled and said: "You want to hear the way from me?". "Yes", I said, "as I can not find it myself." "Give it up, give it up", he said and he swung around with the momentum of someone who wanted to be alone with his laughter. </bdo>
