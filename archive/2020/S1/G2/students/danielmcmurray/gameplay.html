				<p>Above is a gamplay recording of the level I made in Unreal Engine version 4.25.1.  I developed the scene with the support of YouTube tutorials and official UE4 documentation. The assets (including animations), textures anad game sounds are made in blender 2.83 and Audacity. Photoshops image processor script was used to resize all textures for a smaller and more optimized game file.
				<br>The focus of this project was to create a space that was created by my own concepts and try to make as much stuff as I could from my own sources. The floating head in the center of my screen is a self portrait I made in blender with a mirror and the robot is an iteration of the bitsy game I created. All of the floating items were made during the tutorial on blender and I wanted to incorporate the work made as a sort of visual diary that exists in a three dimensional space as the theme of this unit is autobiography. I look at jthius theme mostly through the lense of documentation as a timeline.</br><p>
