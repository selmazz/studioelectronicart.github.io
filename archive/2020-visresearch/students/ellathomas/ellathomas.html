  <!-- do not remove this footer. You may change style/formatting (e.g. padding,
  font face, colour) in your CSS file but it must remain fixed at the bottom of
  the page, and contain the same text. It must appear on all pages of your
  personal site.
References: I was wanting to go down a nostalgic route, looking at the intro of The Simpsons and the wallpaper in Toy Story.
The Simpsons: https://giphy.com/gifs/season-11-the-simpsons-11x12-3orif6mG1esCqg3qec
Toy Story: https://www.deviantart.com/luxojr888/art/Toy-Story-Cloud-Wallpaper-808048773
I was also considering Petra Cortrights webpage and her use of gifs - https://www.petracortright.com/hello.html
The art style I used was based on Microsoft paint with its finish. I also used this for my zine!
