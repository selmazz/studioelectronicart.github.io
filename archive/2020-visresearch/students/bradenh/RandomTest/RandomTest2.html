			<p> Every Youtube url contains a string on 11 characters. For example "dQw4w9WgXcQ" placed after "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=" will take you to Rick Astley's 1987 hit "Never Gonna Give You Up". According to YouTube's own statistics, there are over 1 billion hours of content consumed on a daily basis.
				<br>
			Those 11 characters pull from a pool of 63 total options. That means that there are
				<br>
				3,558,497,368,608
				<br>
				potential combinations for a YouTube link.
