	<p style="text-align: center;">This work is an exploration of the program Processing and the theme Truth.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">Exploring the theme of Truth has made me question my own beliefs, ideas and perspective towards and about truth.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">This work allows viewers to come to their own conclusions about Truth, and consider what it means to them rather than me.</p>
