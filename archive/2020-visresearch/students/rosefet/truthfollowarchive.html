	<p style="text-align: center;">This work is an exploration of the program Processing and the theme Truth.</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;">This work aims to convey how truth wil relentlessly follow you wherever you go- as it is essentially inescapable and will always exist, even if hidden from view.</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;">This work is a representation of the guilt that may follow you for speaking the truth, as well as the cosequences and the impact the truth may have- on you and others.</p>
