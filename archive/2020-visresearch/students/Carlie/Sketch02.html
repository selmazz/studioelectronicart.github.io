        <p> I started to  tinker with my last processing sketch porting it into the web applet version of Processing AKA <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a>
          <br>
        My sketch didn't really translate directly (probaly because I understand about 70% of whats going on with these sketches) so I ended up returning to an earlier verson and getting into creating arrays and taking a second run at more of a pen type drawing tool. I hope you enjoy it, if you want to edit your own copy or view the source code  <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/carlienorma/sketches/LsAbNZBxz">this is the link</a>
