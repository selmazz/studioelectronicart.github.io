      <p>In week 1 we were asked to address the topic of truth in the form of a vlog. I chose to explore
        introspective honesty and the pursuit of subjective truth via the fortune telling practices of
        Astrology and Tarot. These practices rely on the perceived authenticity of tradition and ritual
        to deliver universal statements that can be read in any number of ways that suit the reader.
        Astrology and Tarot are popular topics online, many social media accounts (serious or not) are
        built around them. In the past, a role performed by an expert in star charts and people reading,
        it’s now a simple online survey that generates your zodiac, ascendant sign’s etcetera. The
        removal of the human practitioner from this experience obscures the previously obvious value
        extraction of currency exchange for expert-pseudo-psych validation, and replaces it with
        advertisements, and data collection in exchange for pages of personality traits, predictions and
        sketchy illustrations of anthropomorphised animals in cosmic habitats.</p> <br>

        <p>In addition to online streaming content like Assembly Line Yeah! the production and format of my
          vlog’s were influenced by the short film Heaven-Hell by experimental film maker Dirk de Bruyn. de
          Bruyn collage’s together footage and audio to frame a gross image of limbo between the future and
          the past. The image is formatted like a particularly intense webpage, blocked into headers, navigation
          etc with scrolling objects interrupting confronting bodily footage (all collected from the internet
          archive) demanding your attention like permissions and advertisements. I read the random juxtaposition
          of emoji-like icons bouncing across the frame as critique on global communication technology’s irreverent
          constant demand for our attention. I also felt that it acknowledged the common practice of viewing
          multiple screens simultaneously and the viewers growing appetite for information saturation. I wanted
          my vlogs to embrace this, and documented myself from multiple angles to deliver differently paced streams
          of information. I further fragmented the documentation of my own image to obscure my physical presence
          in the video and ultimately online.</p><br>

          <p>In the following weeks we engaged with Kaprow’s “The Education of the Un-Artist” (1993, 97) a text
            concerned with the complex delineation distinguishing Art from things that are not Art. In reflection
            on the internet’s status as a site, support, and material interest of countless artists it fitsfairly
            neatly into Kaprow’s delineation of Nonart. This is extended as Boris Groys describes in the introducing
            paragraphs of “Art Workers: between Utopia and the Archive” (2013), that the internet has been merged
            into the institutional hegemony of the Art-world, just like Kaprow’s Nonart before it. Groys frames
            the internet in its own iteration of Antiart, as a hyper archive with the capacity as ultimate support,
            documentary tracker and medium for the Figure 1 - Dirk de Bruyn. 2018. Heaven- Hell. Experimental Film
            shown at Revelations Film Festival in 2019. 16 May 2020 Carlie Norma Germs production of artistic identity
            free from the subjects limiting physicality. Subjective truth was the topic of most vlogs shared within
            the class, I think this reflects honestly the default assumption for most people, at least for those immersed
            in the internet’s globalized culture as their primary culture and source of information.</p><br>

        <p>The blog discussions around the importance of intent and authorship in digital artworks leads
            me to engage with the internet as a ’Nonart’ material and support that is active in my practice.
            I am challenged by this as I find the internet to be both a negative and positive experience. In
            the past I have faced ethical challenges around the use and waste of unsustainable materials,
            for which I have developed processes to minimize new materials and techniques to avoid
            waste. My dilemma with the internet is one of principals and a little fear, to avoid or minimize
            will perpetuate a surface level engagement in concept and outcome. </p><br>

          implications of my intentions, however I feel that it represents progressin my understanding of the
          internet’s material place in my artistic practice. I have moved from the production of a vlog on a
          HTML website mostly disconnected from the majority of the internet, to the employment of the internet’s
          structures as a tool for documentation, exhibition and in the near future potential acceptance of my
          subjective image drowning amongst the cacophony of voices.</p><br>
