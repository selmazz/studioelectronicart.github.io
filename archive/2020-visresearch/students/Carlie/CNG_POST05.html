      <p> Tito, named in honor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Puente">Tito Puente ~ the King of Mambo and legendary Timbales player</a> is a precocious
        feline with a talent for theatrics that is obvious to any lay-person/passing observer. I first had the realization that he is infact a performance artist commiting
        his entire life to a deep exploration into what it means to be a cat, when I joined him on the stairs one afternoon to enjoy the sun's warmpth. His actions had
        already indicated to me that his aesthetic and conceptual sensibilitys were well developed, however in that moment, bathed in afternoon sunlight, he scanned me
        as if aknowleging his audience and returned to his work. <br>
        I am working on developing an Artist~Curator relationship with him to hopefully build him up to an exhibition of some kind (Send me an email NYC!). He appears
        to enjoy participating in the live streams. I am hopeful that he can be recognised for his work as an outside performance artist in his life time.</p>
