      or if you have processing you can run and tinker with <a href="Processing_Drawing/Processing_Drawing.pde" download><br>my sketch here</a><br></h2>

      <p> I made this little program to experiment with Processing and gain a better understanding of how this kind of programming works. This is the most complete version of a sketch that started off by looking at;<br>
        *The 'pulses' example sketch in processing,<br>
        *Some of <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/"><b>Generative Gestaltung's</b></a> works and;<br>
        *Learning about Perlin Noise through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman"><b>The Coding Train's</b></a> YouTube channel.<br>
        <br>
        I was propelled on this tangent by the idea of colaborating with the computer in the same way that you colaborate with a piece of charcoal and surface- not every piece of charcoal is right for the mark you want to make but each piece has a capacity to make a mark that you can exert control over - depending on your skill level you can exert more of less control. Both the viewer and the programmer are struggling to control the computer in this sketch the computer constantly getting caried away by the additive on the end of the loop.

        <i> PS.I tried really hard to make this work in the browser but I couldnt do it - I'm going to try and make it work over the break. Appart from that the MacOSX applette was 70mb(idk how 40 lines of code could be???) so i couldnt upload it - sorry.</p>
